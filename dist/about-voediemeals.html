            <h2>About VoedieMeals</h2>
            <p>VoedieMeals was created as a final assignment for the "Frontend development" bootcamp at NOVI University
                of Applied Sciences. The creator of the website started his career in logistics as a Supply Chain
                Coordinator. After working in this sector for couple of years, he realized it was time to take on a new
                challenge, namely the bootcamp to become a frontend developer. A challenge that has been fantasized
                about for a while.
                <br>
                <br>
                VoedieMeals is labeled as the “hello world” project by the maker. The goal after this
                project is to learn more techniques and to gain experience that the maker can contribute to the
                creation of even more beautiful projects in the future!

            <h2>Why this project?</h2>
            <p>After the creator of this website lived and traveled in Asia for a couple of months, he observed
                how much environmental pollution there is. From that moment on, the interest in sustainability arose.
                Thereby good food has always been a hobby.
                <br>
                <br>
                The climate crisis is increasingly mentioned in politics and in the news. One of the causes of this
                crisis is the current food industry. The production of our food is not sustainable. Throwing away food
                is already a shame on its own, but it also has a negative effect on the environment. With VoedieMeals an
                attempt is made to combat food waste in a playful manner, while also providing users with insights
                into which leftovers they often have themselves. All that to potentially prevent unnecessary food waste.
